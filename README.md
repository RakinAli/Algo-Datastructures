## Intended Learning Outcomes

On completion of the course, students should be able to:
- Describe a number of common algorithms for search and sorting and their properties
- Compare algorithms with regard to time and memory usage
- Implement data structures as linear lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary trees, and search trees
- Identify problems where the data structures above are useful and design simple algorithms with these
- Write programs that use algorithms and data structures by means of good programming principles such as systematic tests and abstraction
- Model problems as search problems and implement algorithms for breadth-first search, depth-first search, or best-first search

In order to:
- Be able to design programs that solve problems by using commonly occurring algorithms and data structures
- Acquire sufficient prior knowledge to be able to take advanced courses in computer science
